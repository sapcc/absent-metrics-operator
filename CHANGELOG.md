## [Unreleased](https://github.com/sapcc/absent-metrics-operator/compare/v0.9.4...HEAD)

### Added

- New `prom-rule-name` flag which can be used to provide a template for AbsencePrometheusRule name generation and consequently absence alert rules aggregation.
- Improved tests by adding dedicated unit tests for alert rule parsing and name generation edge-cases.

### Fixed

- Clean up of absence alert rules when a rule group is deleted.

### Removed

- Heuristic determination of `tier`, `service`, and `support_group` labels. These labels will now be copied over as is from the original alert rule to its corresponding absence alert rule.
- `tier`, `service`, `ccloud/service`, and `ccloud/support-group` labels at the object level (PrometheusRule).
